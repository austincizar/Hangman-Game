# Hangman game
The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words.
The Game: Here, a random word (an animal's name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
The first and last letters in the word are displayed while the others in between are hidden.
When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all hidden letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over. 
For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is gorilla, then user gets 7 + 2 = 9 chances, as gorilla is a seven-letter word.
